# Udacity Maze
by Alex Georgescu

## Versions
Unity Version: Unity 2017.1.0p4

GVR Version: GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

I have built this project for Android

## Additional Information
### Time taken
About 15 hours, including 1 hour of debugging

### What I liked about the project
It was an end to end project, similar to a level in a simple game

### Greatest challenge 
Performance, had to bake lights (most assets static), also used a mobile diffuse shader that significantly degraded quality, removed antialiasing
